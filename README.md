###

I'm an AI and data science professional with a strong academic background and a passion for developing intelligent, data-driven solutions. I recently completed a **Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** from **Queenâ€™s University** in Canada (**GPA 4.3/4.3**).

Before that, I completed a Pre-Masterâ€™s program in Computer Science at Ain Shams University, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I specialized in Bioinformatics and graduated with honors.

I'm actively seeking opportunities as a **Machine Learning Engineer** or **Data Analyst**, where I can apply my skills to solve real-world challenges and contribute to innovative, collaborative teams.
